# Temp-ChessProject
Spin-off of chess in Unity

## Setting up the scene
To set up your scene, drop the game controller prefab into your scene.
If you play the scene, you should see the chess board displayed infront of the camera.

## Vision
The core concept of our game is to create a complete game of chess, but in addition, each player has a set of “special abilities” at their disposal they can periodically use to their advantage. Special abilities will be connected to a system of energy that builds up over time and spent to use an ability. Most moves in the game will follow standard chess rules.

We’re choosing this project because Chess is a rigid game that requires years of dedication and study before one can even begin to create any truly new and effective strategies, and the project seeks to add a new strategic dimension of unpredictability, which will act to “level the playing field,” in a way. More unpredictability places more importance on adaptability and improvisation, instead of endless memorization of positions and strategies. Asymmetric design means that no two games will be the same

**Purpose**: Review each section of the SRS and delegate responsibilities for each section.</br>
**Members in Attendance**: Robert Anderson, Kyle Sarre, Gabriel Davis, Julian Plaisance, Hanna Cunningham </br>
**Goals met**: Kyle will handle sections 1,2 (intro and scope), Julian and Hanna will handle section 3 (User, hardware, and software interfaces), Robert and Kyle, if needed, will work on section 4(functional requirements/system features), and Gabe will work on section 5 (other non-functional requirements).</br>

**Date**: 10-17-16</br>

**Purpose**: Review group's progess on the SDD.</br>
**Members in Attendance**: Robert Anderson, Kyle Sarre, Hanna Cunningham, Julian Plaisance </br>
**Goals met**: Each section was dealt with. However, the developer's perspective/system architecture is incomplete and requires attention.</br>

**Date**: 11/11/16</br>
**Purpose**: Verify the system can be worked on by other team members. Integrate UI with the rest of the system.  </br>
**Members in Attendance**: Kyle Sarre, Juilian, Plaisance</br>
**Goals met**: Realized that the current github configuration was leading to broken prefab and script references in the unity project after pulling, making the project extremely difficult to work on seperately.</br>
